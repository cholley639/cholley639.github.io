    	<h3> A Quick Bio </h3>
    	<p>My name is Cam Holley, and I’m from the North Shore of Massachusetts. I’m currently a senior at Tufts University studying physics and competing on the Tufts Varsity Sailing Team. I work in a high-energy physics lab where I’m researching the effectiveness of TPB-coated lightguide bars in a vacuum. Next year, I hope to work for an innovative technology company that is changing the way we interact with and perceive the world on a daily basis. In addition to sailing and programming, I enjoy exploring the ocean’s coastlines, landscape photography, and reading about 20th century history. </p>
