## Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
There is an index.html file in my UTLN homework server that redirects users from my
ee/cs webpage to my github web page.
My homepage has a picture, resume link, bio link, and my name (Cam).
My resume page has a fully updated version of my most recent resume.




## Time Invested
I've probably spent a combined 20-25 hours on this project. I spent a lot of time
trying to make the home page simple and perfect. Also getting the animation 
right was difficult.
